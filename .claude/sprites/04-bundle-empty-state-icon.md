# Replace Emoji with Icon in Bundle Empty State

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## Problem
The bundle panel currently uses an "emoji box" for the empty state, which feels inconsistent with the rest of the icon-focused experience.

## Goal
Replace the emoji box with an actual icon to maintain a cohesive visual language throughout the application.

## Requirements
- Use an appropriate icon from the library (e.g., empty box, folder, collection icon)
- Maintain similar visual hierarchy to current empty state
- Keep the empty state clear and understandable
- Ensure icon size and styling matches the context

## Benefits
- More cohesive overall experience
- Reinforces the icon-centric nature of the app
- Professional, consistent visual language
- Opportunity to dogfood the icon library itself

## Icon Suggestions
- Empty folder/collection icon
- Plus icon (add first icon)
- Box/package icon
- Grid with dotted outline
